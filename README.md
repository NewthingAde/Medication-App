# Medication-App


## Overview
 I Design this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Javascript. This is my first project i designed.
 
## The Project Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Fill in all fields in the form
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during registration
- Visit blogs
 
## My process
The project is the first project I design from scratch and it took me two weeks to complete. I did the project to understand the HTML, CSS and Javascript. It has helped me improve my basic understanding of javascript, HtML, and CSS. I also understand Boostrap( CSS framework better). This motivate me to build other challenging projects.

## Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Boostrap %
- CSS Grid
-Javascript
 
## What I learned
The project exposes me to Boostrap, CSS Frame work. This is the first project I built with HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Javascript. I learnt how to use Boostrap 5 and I understand better the principle of Javascript with this project.


## Continued development
I will love to do more project Using HTML, CSS, Boostrap 5 to improve my skills
